You can also automatically retrieve all items in emails from winning or expired auctions. If you don't want to do this automatically you can turn that option off, and instead you can right-click on an email and it will automatically take that item to your inventory, and delete the message. It will only delete auction messages, if someone sends you an item in the mail it will take the item, but leave the message. I don't like the idea of automatically deleting messages that may have other text in them.

![](./img/carnival_enemycastbar2.png)


Commands:  
`/cenemycast` `/cecb`

Summary:  
Displays a replication of your targets spell casting bar on your UI, which can be moved around.  
Spell casting time is not something that is available to your WoW client, so I have provided cast times for most (if not all spells).As talents can be a factor on the cast time of some spells, the lowest cast time possible is used
ie. all Shadow Bolt cast times will display at 2.5 seconds even though the player you have targetted doesnt have those specific talents. Interruptions on your target, ie. they get hit, will not adjust the display on your cast bar, as again, its impossible to know if it affected the cast.This currently works for both Alliance and Horde, but has only been really tested playing against alliance characters.Will display either a green cast bar for friendly targets, or a red for a hostile target.  

To move the bars, simply target someone and wait for them to do something, when they do, simply click and drag the FIRST bar that appears.
This might take a few tries, just get a friend to cast their Hearthstone while you have them targetted and this becomes a whole lot easier :)

The information that is displayed is only additional stats provided by your gear. If you do not have any of the the listed stats it will not be visible. Caster Stats does not currently calculate crit, or mana regen from stats like int, spirit, or base crit. It is only mean't to be a quick way of finding the bonuses you are getting from your gear. I may implement more features in the future however.

![CT RaidAssist tooltip](./img/ct_raidassisttt.png)

Commands:  
`/rs`  
`/rar`

Summary:  
In short, CT_RaidAssist reports hp, mana, buffs, and debuffs of anyone or everyone in your raid. You can set it to notify when someone is debuffed with specified types as well as notify when buffs you can recast fade. We''ve added 5 ''MT Target'' options which allow you to specify up to 5 MainTanks''s which users can then select which 1-5 they want to show. When shown, it will show you the target of the person set as MT. It''s a bit similar to EQ''s Target''s Target function though with this, the tank doesn''t even have to be your target. We''ve set it to allow key binding for recasts on notification, so it will say ''player'' has been debuffed by ''debuff name'', press ''key'' to cure. It queues debuffs so you can press the same key x times and cure x people.

You can sort the groups by group, class, or custom sort, and show as many or as few groups as you like. Each group is movable and colors are customizable so you can customize it to your liking. Another addition is the ability to use /rs alerts, which send an on screen alert to everyone using the mod. ''/rs Move to me!'' would show: ''TS: Move to me!'' in user-specified color in the middle of the screen for example. The best way to fully see what it''s capable of is to actually see it in use.

Commands:  
`/elkbuffbar` `/ebb`

Summary:  
This addon provides status bar style indicators for the buffs and debuffs that are currently applied to your character. It will also show temporary weapon buffs like eg poisons, counts for stackable debuffs or buffs with charges and the debuff borders introduced with 1.11. Hopefully this addon will have a much smaller memory footprint than other addons of its kind by using CreateFrame in order to instaciate only as many frames as needed.
